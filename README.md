## Description
This is an Intelligent personal Assistant that runs on a machine learning Algorithm for classification of different conversational labels. 
The Personal Assistant is capable of answering questions, and also capable of responding back in a simple conversation. 
It works by the use of a dataset that has 7 to 8 different labels and its corresponding samples of text (corpus) which was used to train a classifier called Naive Bayes and a model weight file was generated.  
The model generated is then called upon to predict the user's input and make responses based on the predicted label. 
The model Accuracy score is 85.67% when tested against the test datatset, and some modification were made to increase it Accuracy. 
The Responses from the Intelligent Personal Assistant are based on the Actual predictions gotten from the user's input.
